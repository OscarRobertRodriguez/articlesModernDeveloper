### Question:
Describe what a browser session is, and explain what session cookies are and what they are used for.
<hr>

A browser session occurs when ever you visit a website by typing and submit the url address(which really is an ip address).Think of it as visiting going to a physical store, upon entering the store you have created a session. We are also given a session cookie which allows the store to know that we are a unique person as though the store gave us a cart with our name on it. 

When we put items inside are cart the browser will remember what we still have in our cart no matter where we go in the store or even if we forgot our purse in the car. This is what session cookies are used for to remember that we have visited a site before so that we don't get asked the same information or so our broser doesn't forget what we have in our cart. 
 
A session cookie is deleted though when we close the browser but is not destroyed if we just close the tab. There can be as many session cookies as the site needs but you don't want to have too many as it might slow down the site.
