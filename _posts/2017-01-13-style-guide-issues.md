 <h1 style="color:#3CCAE6">The Trouble with Style Guides</h1>

I touched over the benefits of having a style guide in a previous article but even style guides have their disadvantages and can cause trouble when implementing them with a team. I will discuss these issues now.

 <h2 style="color:#3CCAE6">Creativity Zero</h2>

 Now style guides where made so that it would be able to keep a consistent look of a brand across all webpages but the problem with this is that creativity is not encouraged and this might make the site lack that extra polish that will make it stand out.


 <h2 style="color:#3CCAE6">Time to  Update/Develop</h2>
When dealing with style guides to keep the site looking modern and keeping up with best practices the whole guide needs to be updated. This takes a long time and will take up valuable time. 


 <h2 style="color:#3CCAE6">Team Priorites</h2>

 Using a style guide can cause a team of developers to clash over the best styling for the site so it's best to complete the site and bring in a style guide for huge inconsistensies.
