### Question:
Describe JSON and explain what it is used for.
<hr>

JSON was created in 2006 by Douglas Crockford to organize data. 
JSON is related to JavaScript but differs in that JSON is a data format and JavaScript is a programming language. 


It's primarily used used to transmit data between a server and a web application. The main structure of JSON is a key/value you pair. 

```javascript
   "foo": "bar" 
```

Notice how the key has quotation marks around it. This differs from the original javascript notation but that's just how we do things on the JASON side.

JASON also accepts numbers, arrays and objects.

```javascript
 {
  "foo": "Hello",
  "bat": {
    'dog': 2,
    'car': 3, 
  },
  "fat": [1,3,4,5] 
} 
```
