 <h1 style="color:#3CCAE6">HTTP Status Codes</h1>


When sending data or receiving data from a server it would be helpful to have a response letting you know that it was sent successfully like we are familar with the devices we use on a daily basis. You might know that you have received an email because your phone makes a sound; this is the same purpose of HTTP status codes to let you know when a request to the server was successful or if it wasn't but can also notify you of other things which we will discuss next. 

 <h2 style="color:#3CCAE6">Types of Status Codes</h2>

 * **1xx Informational**
   * codes starting with one  means that request has been received and will continue
 * **2xx Success**
   * starting with two means the action was received, understood and accepted
 * **3xx Redirection**
   * starting with three means further action must be taken for the the request to be completed
 * **4xx Client Error**
   * means request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fufilled 
 * **5xx Server Errror**
   * means server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
