### Question:
Explain the built-in SyntaxError type and give at least one example in which this error type will be thrown.
<hr>


A SyntaxError is an error that is caused by not having the proper syntax of the language for example.  

```javascript
 // throws 
 var dfjf = 5;;

// this returns a syntax error because it has one braces are different
/ function bats( ) { return 'bats'; ) ; /

```


SyntaxErrors are pretty easy to fix when using programs to write code as they will point these mistakes out.
