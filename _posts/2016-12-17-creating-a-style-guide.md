### Question:
List and explain the steps for creating a style guide.


<h1 style="color:#3CCAE6">How to make a style Guide</h1>


The first ingredient to making a style guide is to use carrots-just kidding not carrots - but what we need is a ingredient list so let's do that. 


<div style="border: 1px dashed green; padding: 20px;background-color:lightblue">
    <h2 style="text-align: center;margin-top:-10px;color:white">Cooking Instructions for a Style Guide</h2>
    <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
    <li>identify basic UI elements</li>
    <li>Group Components</li>
    <li>Create Molecules and Organisms</li>
    <li>Create a template</li>
    </ul>
  
  1. Gather all your basic UI elements and lay them out on your cutting board <br>
  2. Now that gather your UI elements and combine them in a bowl <br>
  3. Pour some into different pans put in oven for minute<br>
  4. Pop out the cakes(organisms) and then layout to form various templates such as a homepage template 
   

</div>

Hopefully you see now that a style guide follows the principles of atomic design in that we start with small parts then build on that till we get to the template phase.
