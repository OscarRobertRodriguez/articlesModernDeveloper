### Question:
Explain what Style Guide Driven Development means and describe the merits of such a development methodology.

<blockquote>
<strong>Definition of methodology</strong><br>
    :  a body of methods, rules, and postulates employed by a discipline :  a particular procedure or set of procedures
</blockquote>

Why follow the rules and procedures of creating a Style Guide? What are the benifits of this system? 

The benifits lie in the uniformity that can be given on a large site with a large team. Sites such as Starbucks can employ a lot developers and designers in building their site and that's where the style guide comes in. This allows prebuilt styles for everyone to pull from so a submit button looks the same no matter where one is used on the site etc. 

Style guide development then means creating a database of all the componets that will be used on a site so that consistency and coordination are easily maintainable between a large team so that the site looks like it was built by one person.
