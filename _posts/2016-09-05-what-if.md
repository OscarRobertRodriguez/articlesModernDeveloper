### Question:
Describe the purpose and function of JavaScript `if` statements and demonstrate how they work.

<hr>



An `if` statement gives the program the ability to make a decision which is necessary for most programs. For example, you might say "If the word is spelled correctly then I will get a message that it was correct" In Javascript, this can be written as: 

```javascript
    if (x === str) {
     document.write("you spelled it correctly");
     } 
```
Here `x` is compared to a string and if they match you get a message that its correct. 


### Syntax

There are several parts to the construction of an if statement. First, you write `if` then its followed by a `(` then the text condition  closed off by the `)`. Next, you have a curly brace `{` to mark the beginning of the block of code. Any time in Javascript the `{}` are used they mark out a block of code so that any code within runs line by line till it get to the last curly brace. Each line in the curly braces ends with a semicolon, `;` .

Although you could get away without using the curly braces if you only have one line of code to run I would advise you not to as this could cause problems if you forget to add when needed. 

```javascript
\\ This will work but better to just use braces
if (x === str) 
 document.write("Hello");
 
\\ This won't work only the first line of code will run
if(x === str) 
document.write("Hello");
alert("Goodbye") ;

\\ Best way  do this all the time
if(x === str) {
document.write("Hello");
alert("Goodbye");
}
 
```  

### Example Simple:
<p data-height="203" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="mAyxJx" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="nopity" data-embed-version="2" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/nopity/pen/mAyxJx/">Simple if</a> by oscar (<a href="http://codepen.io/nopity">@nopity</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

### Example Complex:

Here's a Fahrenheit to Celsius program, don't worry about the other stuff but as you can see it uses two `if` statements. When the variable is over zero or equal to 100 it will print that statement to the console. Try entering 212 to see this in action.

<p data-height="361" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="zKxWOA" data-default-tab="js,result" data-user="nopity" data-embed-version="2" data-preview="true" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/nopity/pen/zKxWOA/">Fahrenheit to Centigrade</a> by oscar (<a href="http://codepen.io/nopity">@nopity</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
