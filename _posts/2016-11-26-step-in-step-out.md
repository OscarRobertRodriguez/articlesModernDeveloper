### Question:
Explain the difference between "Step into next function call" and "Step over next function call."


<h1 style="color:#3CCAE6">Step into function call</h1>

The difference in these two calls is that the step into call will enter a function if its on that line but if there is no function on the current line it will continue to the next line like the step over call.


<h1 style="color:#3CCAE6">Step over function call</h1>

The step over call will "step over" a line that contains a function instead of going into it but that function will still be executed. So we could say step in gives you more information to debug but step over can be useful to see where the general area the problem is at.
